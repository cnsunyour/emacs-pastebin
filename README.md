# Emacs Pastebin Interface

This is a huge inteface to pastebin.com. With it you can
* Paste buffers 
* Fetch pastes
* Delete pastes
* Get a nice list of pastes
* Sort the pastes list by data, title, private, format, key

## Install
``` bash
cd ~/.emacs.d/
wget https://github.com/gkos/emacs-pastebin/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip 
emacs-pastebin-master/
make
```

Then put this on your `.emacs` file:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/emacs-pastebin/")
(require 'neopastebin)
(pastebin-create-login :dev-key "YOURDEVKEY
                       :username YOURUSER")
```

Restart emacs or eval .emacs again.
On emacs `M-x pastebin-l<TAB> <RET>`
Type password
Save password in disk, it will be saved in clear text at `~/.emacs.d/pastebin-data/pass` or whatever you set to `pastebin-data-dir`. If you really care, you can setup this variable to an encrypted partition. :P

You should see a list of pastes on your screen.

## Usage
